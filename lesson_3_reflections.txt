When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to start collaborating with others for example or simply share your code with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because this way I can have more control over what gets into my local repository.
