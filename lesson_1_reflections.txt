How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

 Having access to the entire history of a file helps by quickly fixing new issues if anything goes wrong in a new version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
